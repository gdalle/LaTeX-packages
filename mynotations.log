./mynotations.tex:44: LaTeX Error: Command \qedsymbol undefined.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

                            {$\color{black}{\blacksquare}$}
Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.

./mynotations.tex:78: Undefined control sequence.
l.78 \tikzstyle
               {bnedge} = [->, >={triangle 45}]
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
