# LaTeX-packages

My personal LaTeX and Beamer setup, with all the packages I use on a regular basis.

To use it, clone or download this repo and modify either `article.tex` or `beamer.tex`. You can also put the style files directly in your [TeX home directory](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te).

Other style files of interest:
